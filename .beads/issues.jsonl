{"id":"actsix-9tl","title":"Support Widows in Need","description":"We have tags for Widow, and Widower, and we have deacon assignments.  But only some of the widows would have a deacon assignment.  But we also would want to trace the needs of our widows, even if our men may not be the right people to contact them.  The summary page works only off of assignments, so it isn't quite the right model for Widows in Need.  Will probably start with combining the Widow and Long Term Needs and Shut-In tags to generate a Summary list.
