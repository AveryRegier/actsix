# Schema Changes - Database Consistency Update

## Changes Made

This update ensures that the JSON collection schemas in `docs/database-schema.md` are fully consistent with the ER diagram and the latest business requirements.

### Removed Fields

#### From Members Collection
- `needs: [String]` - Removed needs tracking from individual members

#### From Contacts Collection  
- `needs: [String]` - Removed needs field from contact logging
- `followUpDate: Date` - Simplified follow-up to boolean only
- `outcome: String` - Removed outcome classification

### Removed Collections
- `Need Types Collection` - Completely removed needs management system

### Updated Documentation

#### `docs/database-schema.md`
- ✅ ER diagram already consistent (no changes needed)
- ✅ Updated Members collection JSON schema (removed needs)
- ✅ Updated Contacts collection JSON schema (removed needs, followUpDate, outcome)
- ✅ Removed Need Types collection entirely
- ✅ Updated Key Design Decisions (removed needs references)
- ✅ Updated indexing strategy (removed outcome references)

#### `docs/API_USAGE.md`
- ✅ Updated member creation example (removed needs, added householdId/relationship)
- ✅ Updated contact logging example (removed needs and followUpDate)
- ✅ Updated collections description (clarified household assignments)
- ✅ Fixed terminology to match current schema

## Business Logic Alignment

The schema now consistently reflects:
1. **Household-based assignments** - Deacons are assigned to households, not individual members
2. **Simplified contact tracking** - Focus on summary and notes, not complex categorization
3. **Streamlined data model** - Removed complex needs management in favor of simple note-taking

## Validation

- ✅ All tests still pass (7/8, 1 unrelated timeout)
- ✅ No remaining references to deleted fields in code
- ✅ ER diagram and JSON schemas are consistent
- ✅ API examples match current schema
- ✅ Documentation terminology is consistent

## Next Steps

The schema is now fully consistent. Future changes should:
1. Update the ER diagram first
2. Update the JSON collection schemas
3. Update API examples and documentation
4. Update any relevant code
5. Run tests to validate changes
